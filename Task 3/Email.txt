Hi Julia, 

Hope you are well. 

I am pleased to advise that we have completed the analysis for the category, with a focus on consumer behavior and the trial store layouts. Please find attached the report for your review. 

At a high level, we have found that: 

Mainstream Young Singles & Couples remain the primary shoppers of chips 
Opportunities have been identified with Young and Older Families 
Trial store performance was increased as a result of the new store layout
We are looking forward to discussing these results further next week. 

Warm regards,

(Your name)
